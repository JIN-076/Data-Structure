_Data Structures and Algorithms are not compulsory for programmers, but compulsory for better programmers.<br>
Invest your time in learning Data Structure and algorithms. <br>
**Become a better programmer who makes better solutions!**_
ðŸš€ðŸš€

## Features

- _**Do not use built-in Libraries** that are basically implemented, but implement them directly._
- _Include the Implenented DS, continue to create new DS._
- _Solves problem by applyting the Implemented DS to Algorithms._
- _Through **pair programming**, a single code is completed on a single computer with Team members changing every week._
- _After completing the Weekly Assignment within the period, present it to members, and **refactoring it with better code**._

## Assignments
[2021.08.09]() - Team Matching : [ jhong, yejeong ]
> _Implementation for `ArrayList` , `Linked List` without using `Array` Func._
- Implementing Library that work just like the functs of an `Array`.
- Not using the functs of an `Array` that is a built-in.
- For a Linked List, all `Singly`, `Doubly`, `Circular` must be implemented.
<br>

[2021.08.19]() - Team Matching : [ jhong, yeukim ]
> _Implementation for Reverse `Linked List` Func._
- In the `Singly Linked List` previously implemented, Implement Additional func that reverse the order of list.
- Using a `Linked List`, take two polynomials as factors and implement a Library that calculates the sum as a new list.
<br>

[2021.08.23]() - Team Matching : [ jhong, yeukim ]
> _Implementation for `Stack` for `ArrayList` and `Linked List`._
- When Implementing a `Stack` , the `ArrayList` and `Linked List` , which were previously implemented as libraries, should be included.
- Even if it's not a stereotyped func, **if you think it's a func you need, Implement it**.
- Write a func that determines whether the parentheses present in the formula match by entering a `char *`.
<br>

[2021.08.26]() - Team Matching : [ jhong, donghyki ]
> _Implementation for Advanced `Stack` , Algorithm for **Finding Maze Path**._
- Using the `Stack` , solve the algorithm that finds the path to a given Maze.
- If you need a `2 Dimensional Array` , modify the `ArrayList` that you implmeneted before and implement it directly.
- Beyond simply solving the problem, it should also be noted **how to visually represent the solution process**.
- Instead of using the existing `pair` STL, you'll have to think **how to push the coordinates in the `Stack`**.
<br>

[2021.08.29]() - Team Matching : [ jhong, donghyki ]
> _Implementation for `Circular Queue` and `Dequeue`._
- Implement the same `Stack` as before, using only the library you have implemented.
- `Queue` should be implmented using `Array` , `List` and `Dequeue` should be implemented using `List`.
